Both projects involve data analysis and it would be a great idea to learn R language to support my current and future projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAphantophryne\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTilapia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have traveled to four continents.\nI can cook nice Chinese food.\nI want to be able to speak several languages in the future.\n\n\n\n\nCheck out this website!
