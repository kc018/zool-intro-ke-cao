## Welcome to my site!

### About me

My name is Ke and I'm a senior marine biology undergraduate student at UH Manoa. 

### Experience with Data Science and Research Interest

I took an intro level Python class and a biostatistic class that covered some R computation. 

I'm currently working on the phylogenetic analysis of a mysterious frog genus *Aphantophryne* and physiological analysis of Mozambique tilapia gill. Both projects involve data analysis and it would be a great idea to learn R language to support my current and future projects.
